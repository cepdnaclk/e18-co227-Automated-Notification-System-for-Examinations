This is an automated system that can be used on examination tasks. The system is able to send reminders (basically via email) to respective parties, which consist of the information about their task before a few days to the deadline.

The task schedule is to be filled by a user in a system supported order on a Google Sheet and the reminder sending part is done automatically.

Technologies and Protocols which are used in this project are,
* Google Sheets and Sheets API (data input and fetching)
* Python (programming language)
* MySQL (DBMS)
* Github (Version Control)
